# GBHelpers
Bbasic scripts to activate/deactivate  gb project. 

The idea is to mock the anaconda activate venv scrpits.
We have two commands agb (ActivateGB), and dgb (ActivateGB).

They will export a gopath and some nice env varaibles to make your prompt look pretty and make sure the standard go tooling works inside any editor.
OFC. It's way better to use gb build , instead of go build. But vet/lint/oracle don't digest gb architecture.
