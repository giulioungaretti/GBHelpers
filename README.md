The idea is to mock the anaconda activate venv scrpits.
We have two commands agb (ActivateGB), and dgb (DeactivateGB).

They will export a gopath and some nice env variables to make your prompt look pretty and make sure the standard go tooling works inside any editor.

**OFC** It's way better to use gb build , instead of go build. But vet/lint/oracle don't digest gb architecture.
